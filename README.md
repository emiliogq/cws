# Vehicle Routing Problem

This repo is a Python implementation to solve the [VRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem), using the [CWS heuristic](https://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/solution-methods/heuristics/savings-algorithms/)

This repo also provides a multi-start bias-randomized version of the CWS version, using a skewed theoretical probability distribution, i.e. geometric distribution
